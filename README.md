# Digital-Envelope
A digital envelope is a secure electronic data container used to encrypt and authenticate data to
protect messages. Using a digital envelope, users can encrypt data quickly using secret keys and
conveniently and securely with public keys.
Secret (symmetric) key and public key encryption are used as the two layers of encryption in a
digital envelope. The encoding and decoding of messages uses secret key encryption. A secret
key is transmitted over a network using public key encryption. Plain text communication is not
necessary for this strategy.
It is possible to make a digital envelope using either of the following techniques:
• For message encryption, use algorithms using secret keys like Rijndael or Two fish.
• RSA's public key encryption algorithm is used to encrypt a recipient's secret key using
the recipient's public key.
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a well-known data cryptography programme that also offers
cryptographic privacy and data transmission authentication, is an example of a digital envelope.
